Interaction.py - where all code lies
students.sql - what I used to create and initialize the Student table in pgadmin

Instructions:
1. Run Interaction.py
2. Follow the instruction in the terminal (code written in main()) 

** For addStudents(), the enrollment date needs to be in this format: #-#-#, else it'll throw an error
** The first or the second run might throw an error. If it does, rerun and it'll work.
